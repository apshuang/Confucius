    "thought": "The issue is caused by network packet loss affecting Raft consensus, leading to duplicate insertions. To reproduce this, we first ensure the cluster is running normally, then introduce network packet loss on node2’s Raft port while executing an insertion. The scope for the workload operations is chosen to ensure consistency verification on affected nodes. The network loss is applied to 'any_follower' to simulate issues in Raft replication. We verify the effects by running a select query and checking data integrity after the fault is removed.",
